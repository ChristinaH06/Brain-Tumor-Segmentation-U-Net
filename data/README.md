# Brain Tumor Segmentation using U-Net

This repository contains the final project for the Computer Vision course.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to perform automatic brain tumor segmentation on MRI images using a U-Net based deep learning model. Manual segmentation by radiologists is time-consuming and subjective. This project aims to provide an automated solution that generates pixel-level tumor masks efficiently.

## Dataset

We use the LGG MRI Segmentation Dataset from Kaggle, which contains brain MRI images and corresponding binary tumor masks.
